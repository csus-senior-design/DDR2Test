WARNING:NgdBuild:931 - The value of SIM_DEVICE on instance
   'ddr_interface/u_ddr2/memc3_infrastructure_inst/u_pll_adv' of type PLL_ADV
   has been changed from 'VIRTEX5' to 'SPARTAN6' to correct post-ngdbuild and
   timing simulation for this primitive.  In order for functional simulation to
   be correct, the value of SIM_DEVICE should be changed in this same manner in
   the source netlist or constraint file.
